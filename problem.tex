\section{Problem description}

The key points of the Visual Basic Application based malware are the accessibility and the popularity of the Office Products. This is ensured both to the fact that the Visual Basic Application language grants access to the majority of the functions implemented in Windows API and to the spreading of the Office Products both in business and non-business domains. According to a statistic made by Spiceworks\footnote{https://community.spiceworks.com/software/articles/2873-data-snapshot-the-state-of-productivity-suites-in-the-workplace} nearly 82\% of enterprises use Microsoft Office. Knowing that, it is easier for an attacker to build a malicious program which will be granted to run, with a certain probability on the target machine.
